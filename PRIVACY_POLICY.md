# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 8, 2025

## 1. Data Collection
This Bot does not actively collect, store, or share personal information beyond what is necessary for its intended functions. Any temporary data used (e.g., user IDs, channel IDs) is stored only in memory and not saved permanently unless explicitly required by a feature.

## 2. Third-Party Access
No data is shared with third-party services. Only the bot owner has access to the Bot and its operation.

## 3. Data Retention
If any user or server-related data is stored temporarily for configuration or functionality (e.g., moderation settings), it will be kept only as long as necessary and can be deleted upon request by the server owner.

## 4. Your Rights
As this is a private-use bot:
- Users may request removal of any stored data by contacting the bot owner directly.
- If you do not wish the Bot to interact with your data, please request removal of the Bot from your server.
