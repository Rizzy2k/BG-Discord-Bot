# 📌 Bot Purpose & Overview

## 🎮 What is this bot?

This is a **private, whitelist-only Discord bot** designed specifically to help players **report teamers** in **Roblox battleground games**.

Teamers are players who unfairly team up to jump or harass solo players in games where teaming is not allowed. This bot provides a simple way for the community to report these players quickly and fairly.

## ⚔️ Supported Games

## 📋 How it works

1. **Submit a Report**  
   A player uses the bot to submit a report when they encounter teamers in-game.

2. **Fill in Details**  
   The bot prompts the reporter to provide basic details about the incident and the teamers.

3. **Link Roblox Account**  
   Using **Roblox OAuth 2.0**, the reporter can securely link their Roblox account. The bot then:
   - Collects their **Roblox username**
   - Collects their **display name**
   - Generates their **profile URL**

   This helps moderators and other players quickly verify the report and find the reporter’s in-game session if needed.
